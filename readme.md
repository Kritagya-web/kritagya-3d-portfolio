# Inspiration

The project is being taken inspiration from Joan Ramos Refusta project. This is an initial setup and a lot of changes are being worked upon to make it my own.

Thank you

# Kritagya Kumra's Portfolio

Welcome!
I've always wanted to create a portfolio showcasing my skills with GLSL shaders and Three.js, along with a platform to display all my side projects and experiments. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my journey as a 3D developer and a place to explore my various side projects, including video games. I've included elements that reflect my personal interests, such as my favorite video games, an interactive Rubik's cube, and an arcade machine.

You can now explore it [here](https://kritagyaramosrefusta.com/).
